Hi there!

I'm a Software Engineer/Cloud Achitect at [Q42](https://www.q42.nl/en/about-q42),
currently working on the [Philips Hue project](https://www.q42.nl/en/work/philips-hue1).
Sometimes I'll post something technical at [hermanbanken.nl](https://hermanbanken.nl),
or open source some work, which you'll find below.

Happy coding, Herman
